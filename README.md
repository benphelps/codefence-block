# codefence

codefence.io is an easy to embed editor and compiler for over 20 server-side programming languages.

Everything is run securely inside dedicated sandboxed Docker containers and, once executed, destroyed. We never store your code on our servers, and only the results are cached (you can opt-out of this as well).

Perfect for examples, tutorials, and technical documentation, allowing the reader to interact with the code and make changes.

## Installation

Install like any other plugin, no extra steps are required.

## Usage

You can find the codefence block under the Embeds section in the Gutenberg editor.

## Support

If you run into problems or need help, visit our website and send us a message using our contact form.
